\title{Calculation of the Mean Radiant Temperatur (MRT)
}
\description{
This function calculates the mean radiant temperature (mrt) from radiation long- and shortwave fluxes of all directions according to Thorsson et al. 2007. %%  ~~ A concise (1-5 lines) description of what the function does. ~~
}
\usage{
calc_mrt(x)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{x}{
This functions need an input table with all fluxes from all directions for instance as it comes from a human response station.}
}
\details{
%%  ~~ If necessary, more details than the description above ~~
}
\value{
The value is rounded to two digits.
