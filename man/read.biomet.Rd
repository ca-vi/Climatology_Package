\usage{

}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{file_bm1}{
The path (relative or absolute) to the CR1000_BIOMET1.dat file.
}
  \item{file_bm2}{
The path (relative or absolute) to the CR1000_BIOMET2.dat file.
}
  \item{file_wm}{
The path (relative or absolute) to the CR1000_BIOMET2_Gill_Windmaster.dat file.

  \item{all}{
If all=TRUE there will be no sorting out the redundant and less important columns.
